BitWorks is an inexpensive open source game designed around learning
verilog and assembly language fundamentals of computer architecture,
digital logic design and programming. It takes place in a make-believe
world where our protagonist forms a rag tag computer startup on his
old 8 bit computer with the help of his friends over email.

The game is designed to be fun and educational, exposing the player to
the inner workings of a simple computer architecture from the ground up.

The game is written in verilog and and a fictional assembly language
called JASM for the J16 processor. The J16 is a simple 16 bit turing
complete architecture with a retro single-cycle Harvard architecture
with a simple and approachable design. It is designed to compliment a
book like "But How Do It Know?" by J. Clark Scott and to instill the
desire of googling and learning more about computer architecture,
digital logic design and programming along the way, for use inside
and outside the game some day.
