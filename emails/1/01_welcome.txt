Welcome to BitWorks Digital Logic Design Course!

LEVEL 1: Building Basic Logic Gates
===================================

Congratulations on starting your journey into digital logic design! In this first level, you'll learn the fundamentals of building logic gates using Verilog.

YOUR MISSION:
Create a NOT gate (inverter) module using the provided NAND gate component.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
- Understanding module instantiation in Verilog
- Using primitive gates to build complex logic
- Proper input/output port declarations
- Module naming conventions

RESOURCES PROVIDED:
- nand.v module (pre-implemented NAND gate)
- Template files in workspace folder
- Reference documentation in subsequent emails

GETTING STARTED:
1. Read the technical specification email for detailed requirements
2. Study the NAND module interface in the reference email  
3. Create your NOT gate module in workspace/not.v
4. Test your implementation using the provided test cases

Remember: A NOT gate can be implemented using a single NAND gate with both inputs tied together!

Good luck, and welcome to the world of digital design!
