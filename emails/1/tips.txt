Student,

If you're stuck on the AND gate implementation, here's a quick tip:

The AND operation in SystemVerilog is represented by the & operator.

For two inputs 'a' and 'b', the AND gate can be implemented as:
assign y = a & b;

This is much simpler than you might think!

Also, don't forget to save your work using F1 -> Save File.

Best regards,
Prof. Gates
