Level 1 Implementation Tips
===========================

Having trouble getting started? Here are some helpful tips for implementing your NOT gate:

STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH:

1. CREATE THE MODULE SKELETON:
   Start with the basic module structure:
   ```verilog
   module not(
       input wire a,
       output wire y
   );
   
   endmodule
   ```

2. ADD THE NAND INSTANTIATION:
   Inside your module, instantiate the nand component:
   ```verilog
   nand nand_gate (
       .a(a),
       .b(a),    // Key insight: connect both inputs to 'a'
       .y(y)
   );
   ```

3. UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC:
   Why does NAND(a,a) = NOT(a)?
   - When a=0: NAND(0,0) = NOT(0 AND 0) = NOT(0) = 1
   - When a=1: NAND(1,1) = NOT(1 AND 1) = NOT(1) = 0
   
   This is exactly the NOT gate truth table!

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- Don't forget the semicolon after endmodule
- Make sure instance names are unique (nand_gate, nand_inst, etc.)
- Use dot notation for port connections (.port_name(signal))
- Double-check that both NAND inputs connect to the same signal

TESTING YOUR WORK:
Once you've implemented your NOT gate, mentally trace through:
- Input a=0 → NAND inputs both 0 → NAND output 1 → y=1 ✓
- Input a=1 → NAND inputs both 1 → NAND output 0 → y=0 ✓

VERILOG SYNTAX REMINDER:
- Modules end with 'endmodule'
- Wire connections use dot notation: .port(wire)
- Instance format: module_name instance_name (connections);

You've got this! The solution is simpler than you might think.
