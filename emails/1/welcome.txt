Welcome to BitWorks Level 1!

Your task is to implement a basic AND gate using Verilog HDL.

The file 1.sv has been created for you with the basic module structure. You need to complete the implementation by adding the logic for an AND gate.

Remember:
- An AND gate outputs HIGH (1) only when both inputs are HIGH
- The assign statement is your friend
- Check the reference files (nand.sv, not.sv) for examples

Good luck!
